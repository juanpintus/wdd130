        Hello! I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina I like to watch movies, draw, read, have family time, and play video games. I have three siblings, two sisters, and one brother. I am the last child.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have lived in Argentina all my life and served in the Argentina Resistencia Mission during the Covid pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>  
        My parents and I tried to move to Spain last year, but we returned to Argentina one month ago to be with my family and friends.
        I'm thankful for the opportunity to study in this inspired program. I have learned plenty of skills I must apply every day to grow and achieve my goals!
      </p>
      <p>  
        I hope to keep learning,  improving, and receiving the things the Lord has prepared for me. I know He knows our needs and will help us when we let Him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Buenos Aires is the largest and most populous Argentine province. It
        takes its name from the city of Buenos Aires, the capital of the
        country, which used to be part of the province and the province's
        capital until it was federalized in 1880. Since then, in spite of
        bearing the same name, the province does not include Buenos Aires
        proper, though it does include all other parts of the Greater Buenos
        Aires metropolitan area. The capital of the province is the city of La
        Plata, founded in 1882.
